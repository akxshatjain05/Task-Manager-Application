Details of Third-Party Library Integration

1. Room Database
Version: 2.6.1
Purpose: Room is used for local data storage to save tasks and their statuses. It provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow more robust database access while leveraging SQLite’s full power.
implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:2.6.1"
annotationProcessor "androidx.room:room-compiler:2.6.1"

2. RecyclerView
Version: 1.3.2
Purpose: RecyclerView displays a large set of data in a scrollable list reusing the UI without creating it again and again. It’s more efficient than ListView and supports better performance and layout flexibility.
implementation "androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.3.2"

3. Firebase
Version: 33.10.0
Implementation platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:33.10.0")
implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics"
implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics"
implementation “com.google.firebase:firebase-perf:21.0.5”



Explanations of Your Design Decisions
1. UI/UX Design:
The app follows Material Design principles to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.
Task View: Tasks are displayed in a simple list with checkboxes to mark them as completed. When a task is completed, its name is crossed out for clarity.
Task Input: A text input field allows users to add new tasks, and the tasks are stored in a local database.
Task Editing: Tapping a task's name allows the user to edit it. This gives flexibility to modify tasks after creation.
2. Error Handling:
A validation mechanism ensures that users cannot add empty tasks or tasks with only spaces. A toast is displayed when this happens, preventing invalid entries.
Task editing also ensures that only valid task names are saved.
